# Supernova: She Speaks
**Supernova** is an interactive web application that empowers girls across the world to explore their rights and challenge patriarchal norms through story-based narratives.  

This is the first, basic version of the web app.  It contains 5 interactive stories built with [Twine](https://twinery.org/) and a dynamic world map made possible by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
