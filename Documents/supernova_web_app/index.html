  <!--<h1>What We Stand For</h1>
    <p>
      Supernova: She Speaks stands for women and girls around the world.
      We write and spread truth, sparking actions and change within communities.
      We aim to reach each and every region in the world, sharing harmful social
      norms and traditions women face and urging change both explicitly and subliminally 
      through interactive, gamified storytelling.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Envision</h2>
    <p>
      We envision a world where girls don't have to fear being kidnapped to be wives,
      where sisters get the same encouragement as their brothers,
      where girls can live the life they want to live,
      where society sees girls as ends, not means,
      where both genders receive the same pay for the same work,
      where education and freedom are rights, not gender-based privileges,
      and where women receive equal rights as men, legally and socially.
